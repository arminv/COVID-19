**Available Data in COVID-19 (by api-sports):**
- Per country:
{
      "country": "China",
      "cases": {
        "new": "+12",
        "active": 1031,
        "critical": 81,
        "recovered": 77084,
        "total": 82747
      },
      "deaths": {
        "new": null,
        "total": 4632
      },
      "tests": {
        "total": null
      },
      "day": "2020-04-20",
      "time": "2020-04-20T15:30:05+00:00"
    },





**Ideas:**

- Show cases as % of tested - kind of measures probability of being infected in general (when looking at all countries together)
- Compare all countries (in a chart) based on number of: total, deaths and tests and rank them in order
- Get the complete history for each country and show it as a chart (total, deaths, tests over time - one chart)
